**Subject:** Programming Language and IDE Recommendation for New Project

Dear Manager,

The purpose of the memo is to recommend a programming language and an IDE for our new customer's upcoming project. After going through the project requirements and constraints, we recommend Python as the major programming language and VSCode as the IDE. The following are the explanations behind this decision:

1. **Modularity:** Python provides support for modularity through packages, modules, and functions. The use of packages and modules facilitates a structured approach to project development.

2. **Automatic Unit Testing:** Python has an inbuilt testing framework called unittest, inspired by Java's JUnit. It also supports 3rd party testing frameworks such as pytest. 

3. **JSON Handling:** The `json` module in Python provides built-in functionality for JSON handling that makes it easier to read and write JSON data, which is necessary for our project.

4. **HTTP Requests:** Python comes with the library called `requests`, which makes dealing with HTTP requests efficiently, both as a client and a server. 

5. **Graphical User Interfaces:** Tkinter is a built-in choice among Python's several GUI frameworks. There are other well-known third-party libraries, such as PyQt and Kivy. 

6. **IDE Recommendation:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode), while often considered a code editor, provides a versatile development environment. With the right extensions, it offers features comparable to a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Its user-friendly interface, code suggestions, and GitHub integration make it an excellent choice.

7. **Deployment Constraints:** Python is cross-platform, meaning that code written for one operating system can be easily installed on Luddyâ€™s Linux computers and our own computer/OS as well. 

We believe that Python and VSCode align well with the project's requirements and provide a versatile and efficient platform for development. We look forward to your feedback and further guidance on this matter.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Group05
