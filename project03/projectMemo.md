*TO:* The Manager  
*FROM:* [Group 5] <br/>
*DATE:* [02/04/2024]  
*SUBJECT:* Development Plan for Acquire.com


*Objective:* <br/>
We hereby are presenting our development plan for Acquire.com, where we aim to facilitate a competition where developers can test and enhance their skills by creating Acquire game players.
We seek to deliver a running product in stages, with each stage extending the previous one. Additionally, we have included some questions concerning the rules for which we need some clarification.

*Development Stages:* <br/>
*Stage 1:* <br/>
+ Develop a basic version of the game server to help coordinate games. <br/>
+ This should include but not be limited to functionality for players to take turns, placing tiles on the board, and the banker's role in managing money, stock certificates, tiles, and available hotel chains.

*Stage 2:* <br/>
+ Create a registration platform where developers can create their profiles.  <br/>
+ Create an interface where the developers can upload and test their Acquire players. <br/>

*Stage 3:* <br/>
+ Enable real-time communication between players and the server. <br/>
+ Introduce basic matchmaking algorithms for pairing players. <br/>
+ Design a basic game lobby system where developers can create or join game sessions. <br/>

*Stage 4:* <br/>
+ Introduce comprehensive game statistics, leaderboards, and user profiles. <br/>
+ Develop a system for scheduling tournaments and special events. <br/>
+ Introduce community features such as forums and chat systems. <br/>

*Stage 5:* <br/>
+  Conduct extensive testing to ensure platform stability, security, and performance optimization. <br/>
+ Develop a notification system to let users know of special events and tournaments. <br/>
+ Try and deploy a beta version. <br/>



*Questions:* <br/>
1. How should we handle disconnections and timeouts from players? <br/>
2. Can the names of the hotels be configurable? <br/>
3. What should be the criteria for the scoring system? <br/>
4. Can a user have multiple acquire players on board or single user should have only 1 player? <br/>
5. How should the game server handle scalability to ensure that there is no latency in the requests? <br/>
6. What are the bonus amounts for minority and majority? <br/>
7. How often should we display the player statistics and leaderboard details? <br/>
8. Are there any restrictions on algorithms that should be used for ranking different players? <br/>
9. What login features must be supported to enable the user to create an account and log in? <br/>
10. Who will be the banker in the game? Do we ask a user or can our program be implemented to work like a banker? <br/>


Any support and insights are appreciated. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, <br/>
Group 05
